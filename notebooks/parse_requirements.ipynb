The key guiding principle behind the functional design of CCTNS V1.0 is to focus on the critical functionality that provides value to the police personnel at the cutting edge which in turn can improve the outcomes in the areas of вЂњInvestigation of CrimeвЂќ and вЂњDetection of CriminalsвЂќ.     </text_body> </p>  <p id=\"2\">     <title>     FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW     </title>     <text_body>         CCTNS V1.0 functionality is designed to focus on delivering value to IOs, records room staff and citizens within the broad crime investigation area. Based on the guiding principles stated above, nine different function blocks have been identified and the detailed functionality of each block was determined.     </text_body>  </p>  <p id=\"3\">     <title>     DESCRIPTION OF THE MODULES AND FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS     </title>     <text_body>        The functionality of the CCTNS application is focused on providing value to the police personnel, especially the officers operating at the cutting edge and easing the day to day operations of the police function.     </text_body>     <p id=\"\">         <title>         Registration         </title>         <text_body>         Citizens can register their complaints with police and then based on the evidence, facts and following investigation, police shall take the complaint forward. The Registration module acts as an interface between the police and citizens and it eases the approach, interaction and information exchange between police and complainants.         </text_body>     </p>     <p id=\"\">     <title>         Investigation         </title>         <text_body>                 After a complaint is initiated, police initiates the investigation process. The Investigation module of the CCTNS facilitates the investigation process and introduces operational efficiencies by automating most of the tasks that take place after initial entries are made during Registration.         </text_body>     </p>     <p id=\"\">         <title>         Prosecution         </title>         <text_body>         Interfacing with the courts during the prosecution of cases is an integral part of the responsibilities of police personnel. A designated constable from each police station constantly interfaces with the courts. The Prosecution module of the CCTNS aids this interfacing by providing a platform to record entries of the court interactions.                </text_body>     </p>       <p id=\"\">         <title>         Search         </title>         <text_body>         The Search module of the CCTNS gives police personnel the ability to execute a basic or advanced search on cases. Using the search functionality, police personnel can search for a particular person, type of crime, modus operandi, property etc. It also gives the user the ability to customize the results view by criminal/accused or by cases. It makes reporting easy for police by enabling them to execute different types of queries such as monthly reporting, RTI related etc.                 </text_body>     </p>              <p id=\"\">         <title>         Citizen Interface         </title>         <text_body>         The Citizen Interface module of the CCTNS acts as a conduit for the information exchange between citizens and police units/personnel. Citizens can use it as a tool to get information or acknowledgements from police. The police in turn can use it to respond to citizens with very little turnaround time. It improves overall productivity by helping citizens and police to cut short the drudgery of large amounts of paperwork.                 </text_body>     </p>              <p id=\"\">         <title>         Navigation         </title>         <text_body>         The Navigation module of the CCTNS provides role based landing pages which help in navigating through the CCTNS application.

Guidance on selecting and using different forms of interaction techniques is to be found in ISO 9241-14 to ISO 9241-17. ISO 9241-14 gives guidance about menus, ISO 9241-15 about command dialogues, ISO 9241-16 about direct manipulation and ISO 9241-17 about forms. In addition, when designing multimedia information presentations, the design principles and recommendations described in ISO 14915-1 to ISO 14915-3 should be taken into account.

User adaptation can also be important for making the user interface more accessible. Different approaches can be used for achieving these goals, like providing users with means for customizing the user interface to their personal needs i.e. individualization designing content and navigation differently for varying user groups or roles i.e. such as employees of different levels, citizens etc, monitoring the userвЂ™s behaviour and adapting to the userвЂ™s goals that are inferred from the behaviour observed, recommending information that is potentially more relevant or interesting to the specific user, based on the behaviour of all users or a user group.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"43\">            <text_body>            Taking account of the usersвЂ™ tasks and information needs: When providing different access paths or navigation structures for different user groups, the tasks and information needs of these user groups should be taken into consideration.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"44\">            <text_body>            Making individualization and adaptation evident: It should be made evident to the user when individualization and/or adaptation are used.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"45\">            <text_body>            Making user profiles evident: If predefined user profiles or user-specified profiles are used for individualizing or adapting content, the profile currently used should be made evident.

The 3 CвЂ™s (Core-Configuration-Customization) forms the guiding principle for the architecture. The functional architecture of the CCTNS solution is given in the figure below. The functional architecture is composed of 4 major components based on SOA principles. Each of the components contains multiple services as defined by Service Definition. The core services, support layer and security and access control components can be deployed as standard components with necessary configuration changes.

       "'FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE RECOMMENDATIONS     </title>     <text_body>         The proposed functional architecture is modeled around centralized deployment to facilitate ease of maintenance and leverage advancement in open standards and web technologies.         The 3 CвЂ™s (Core-Configuration-Customization) forms the guiding principle for the architecture. The functional architecture of the CCTNS solution is given in the figure below. The functional architecture is composed of 4 major components based on SOA principles. Each of the components contains multiple services as defined by Service Definition. The core services, support layer and security and access control components can be deployed as standard components with necessary configuration changes. The customization layer can override and add to the core services based on the specific state requirements and can be plugged with the core services.         The deployment of the application will be at state level and will be configured and customized as per the state specific extensions.

Typical action types in user interfaces include manipulating application data, performing searches, communication actions, such as opening a new e-mail window or starting a chat function, and presentation-related actions, such as sorting a list of search results.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"29\">            <text_body>            Providing printable document versions: If a document is either too long, dispersed over several pages or in a specific layout that is not suitable for online reading, a printer-friendly version of the document should be provided that prints the content in a form acceptable to the user (e.g. in the expected layout, paper format, or orientation).            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"30\">            <text_body>            Use of вЂњwhite spaceвЂќ: вЂњWhite spaceвЂќ on a page i.e. space filled only with the background color should be used in such a way that it does not impair the visual skimming of the page. While white space is an important means of visually organizing the different content elements on a page, if the distance between the blocks of information displayed becomes too large, rapid skimming of the page can be impeded.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"31\">            <text_body>            Selecting appropriate page lengths The length of a page should be selected so as to support the primary purpose and use of the page. Short pages are generally more appropriate for homepages, navigation pages, or overview pages that need to be read quickly. Longer pages can be more appropriate when users want to read the content without interruptions or when the page needs to match a paper counterpart.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"32\">            <text_body>            Using colour: Colour should be used with care, taking into account human capabilities and restrictions in perceiving colour, and not as the only means of conveying information. Color should never be the only means of coding. Some users may have difficulties in perceiving certain colors or color combinations (color-blindness).            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"33\">            <text_body>            Using frames with care: If frames are used, care should be taken to avoid possible problems, for example, those involving the use of the back button, bookmarking of pages, or scrolling of information. When frames are used, it is important to title each frame, and to describe its purpose and how frames relate to one another other.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"34\">            <text_body>            Providing alternatives to frame-based presentation: If frames are used, an alternative way of presenting relevant information without frames should be provided. Providing alternative text-only pages: When style sheets and/or frames are turned off it should be possible for the user to read and understand the page; alternatively, the user should be provided with an equivalent alternative text-only page.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"35\">            <text_body>           Consistent page layout: Pages should be designed using consistent layout schemes, supporting the user in finding similar information at the same position on different pages. Overall layout schemes apply to all pages and are preferable when all pages have a similar structure. Frequently, however, different pages have different purposes and types of content. In such cases, pages can usually be grouped in different categories, using one layout scheme for each category consistently.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"36\">            <text_body>            Placing title information consistently: Page titles should be placed in a consistent location on the different pages.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"37\">            <text_body>            Observing principles of human perception When designing application pages, the general principles of human perception should be taken into account. The International Standards mentioned below shall be consulted for guidance. Practical guidelines for presenting information to the user are to be found in ISO 9241-12. Guidance on selecting and using different forms of interaction techniques is to be found in ISO 9241-14 to ISO 9241-17. ISO 9241-14 gives guidance about menus, ISO 9241-15 about command dialogues, ISO 9241-16 about direct manipulation and ISO 9241-17 about forms. In addition, when designing multimedia information presentations, the design principles and recommendations described in ISO 14915-1 to ISO 14915-3 should be taken into account. Appropriate content presentation also plays a key role in accessibility.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"38\">            <text_body>            Linking back to the home page or landmark pages: Each page should contain a link leading to the home page of the application or to a landmark page that is easy to recognize for the user.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"39\">            <text_body>            Providing a site map: A separate navigation overview such as a site map should be provided for application showing the structure of the site in an overview form.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"40\">            <text_body>            Consistency between navigation components and content: If navigation components (or overviews) are shown in conjunction with associated content, consistency between the navigation component and the content shown should be maintained by indicating in the navigation component (e.g. highlighting) the topic currently visible in the content area.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"41\">            <text_body>            Placing navigation components consistently: Navigation components should be placed consistently on the pages or in the framesets in the pages of the application.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"42\">            <text_body>            Individualization and user adaptation : Adapting the content and the navigation of a user interface to individual users or user groups can be a useful mechanism for providing information that is of interest to the users and for making access to relevant information more efficient. User adaptation can also be important for making the user interface more accessible. Different approaches can be used for achieving these goals, like providing users with means for customizing the user interface to their personal needs i.e. individualization designing content and navigation differently for varying user groups or roles i.e. such as employees of different levels, citizens etc, monitoring the userвЂ™s behaviour and adapting to the userвЂ™s goals that are inferred from the behaviour observed, recommending information that is potentially more relevant or interesting to the specific user, based on the behaviour of all users or a user group.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"43\">            <text_body>            Taking account of the usersвЂ™ tasks and information needs: When providing different access paths or navigation structures for different user groups, the tasks and information needs of these user groups should be taken into consideration.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"44\">            <text_body>            Making individualization and adaptation evident: It should be made evident to the user when individualization and/or adaptation are used.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"45\">            <text_body>            Making user profiles evident: If predefined user profiles or user-specified profiles are used for individualizing or adapting content, the profile currently used should be made evident.

The key guiding principle behind the functional design of CCTNS V1.0 is to focus on the critical functionality that provides value to the police personnel at the cutting edge which in turn can improve the outcomes in the areas of вЂњInvestigation of CrimeвЂќ and вЂњDetection of CriminalsвЂќ.     </text_body> </p>  <p id=\"2\">     <title>     FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW     </title>     <text_body>         CCTNS V1.0 functionality is designed to focus on delivering value to IOs, records room staff and citizens within the broad crime investigation area. Based on the guiding principles stated above, nine different function blocks have been identified and the detailed functionality of each block was determined.     </text_body>  </p>  <p id=\"3\">     <title>     DESCRIPTION OF THE MODULES AND FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS     </title>     <text_body>        The functionality of the CCTNS application is focused on providing value to the police personnel, especially the officers operating at the cutting edge and easing the day to day operations of the police function.     </text_body>     <p id=\"\">         <title>         Registration         </title>         <text_body>         Citizens can register their complaints with police and then based on the evidence, facts and following investigation, police shall take the complaint forward. The Registration module acts as an interface between the police and citizens and it eases the approach, interaction and information exchange between police and complainants.         </text_body>     </p>     <p id=\"\">     <title>         Investigation         </title>         <text_body>                 After a complaint is initiated, police initiates the investigation process. The Investigation module of the CCTNS facilitates the investigation process and introduces operational efficiencies by automating most of the tasks that take place after initial entries are made during Registration.         </text_body>     </p>     <p id=\"\">         <title>         Prosecution         </title>         <text_body>         Interfacing with the courts during the prosecution of cases is an integral part of the responsibilities of police personnel. A designated constable from each police station constantly interfaces with the courts. The Prosecution module of the CCTNS aids this interfacing by providing a platform to record entries of the court interactions.                </text_body>     </p>       <p id=\"\">         <title>         Search         </title>         <text_body>         The Search module of the CCTNS gives police personnel the ability to execute a basic or advanced search on cases. Using the search functionality, police personnel can search for a particular person, type of crime, modus operandi, property etc. It also gives the user the ability to customize the results view by criminal/accused or by cases. It makes reporting easy for police by enabling them to execute different types of queries such as monthly reporting, RTI related etc.                 </text_body>     </p>              <p id=\"\">         <title>         Citizen Interface         </title>         <text_body>         The Citizen Interface module of the CCTNS acts as a conduit for the information exchange between citizens and police units/personnel. Citizens can use it as a tool to get information or acknowledgements from police. The police in turn can use it to respond to citizens with very little turnaround time. It improves overall productivity by helping citizens and police to cut short the drudgery of large amounts of paperwork.                 </text_body>     </p>              <p id=\"\">         <title>         Navigation         </title>         <text_body>         The Navigation module of the CCTNS provides role based landing pages which help in navigating through the CCTNS application. It shows information such as cases assigned, alerts, pending tasks etc hence helping police personnel to plan better and execute with greater efficiency.                 </text_body>     </p>              <p id=\"\">         <title>         Application Configuration         </title>         <text_body>         The Configuration module of the CCTNS helps keep the application configured according to the statesвЂ™ requirements in addition to keeping data elements/rules up to date. With a proper configuration, information such as act and sections, state specific data, castes, tribes, property information etc. can be created updated and deleted.         The functional requirements for each of the modules are provided as A1 to A7 in separate enclosures.                 </text_body>     </p> </p>  <p id=\"4\">     <title>     NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS     </title>     <text_body>         The non-functional requirements specify the qualitative attributes such as user-friendliness and performance of the system that are critical for the increased user-acceptance of the application.     </text_body>     <p id=\"\">         <title>         Help Module         </title>         <req id=\"1\">             <text_body>                 The solution should provide detailed context-sensitive help material for all the possible actions and scenarios on all user interfaces in the application.             </text_body>         </req>         <req id=\"2\">             <text_body>                 The solution should provide detailed context-sensitive help material for all the possible actions and scenarios on all user interfaces in the application.             </text_body>         </req>     </p>     <p id=\"\">         <title>          </title>         <req id=\"1\">             <text_body>                 The solution should provide an interface for the user to log any defects or enhancement requests on the application and track thereafter.             </text_body>         </req>         <req id=\"2\">             <text_body>                 The solution should send alerts (e.g., email, SMS) to the user if the user chooses to whenever any action has been taken on the alert.             </text_body>         </req>         <req id=\"3\">             <text_body>                 The solution should enable the user to track the submitted defect or enhancement request.             </text_body>         </req>         <req id=\"4\">             <text_body>                 The solution should enable the help-desk user to view the reports on the submitted defects or enhancement requests category-wise, status-wise, and age- wise.             </text_body>         </req>         <req id=\"5\">             <text_body>                 The support solution should be accessible to the users both from within the application and also outside the application through a browser interface.             </text_body>         </req>     </p>          <p id=\"\">         <title>             Audit Module         </title>         <req id=\"1\">             <text_body>                 An audit trail is a record of actions taken by either the user or the system triggers.

Guidance on selecting and using different forms of interaction techniques is to be found in ISO 9241-14 to ISO 9241-17. ISO 9241-14 gives guidance about menus, ISO 9241-15 about command dialogues, ISO 9241-16 about direct manipulation and ISO 9241-17 about forms. In addition, when designing multimedia information presentations, the design principles and recommendations described in ISO 14915-1 to ISO 14915-3 should be taken into account.

User adaptation can also be important for making the user interface more accessible. Different approaches can be used for achieving these goals, like providing users with means for customizing the user interface to their personal needs i.e. individualization designing content and navigation differently for varying user groups or roles i.e. such as employees of different levels, citizens etc, monitoring the userвЂ™s behaviour and adapting to the userвЂ™s goals that are inferred from the behaviour observed, recommending information that is potentially more relevant or interesting to the specific user, based on the behaviour of all users or a user group.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"43\">            <text_body>            Taking account of the usersвЂ™ tasks and information needs: When providing different access paths or navigation structures for different user groups, the tasks and information needs of these user groups should be taken into consideration.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"44\">            <text_body>            Making individualization and adaptation evident: It should be made evident to the user when individualization and/or adaptation are used.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"45\">            <text_body>            Making user profiles evident: If predefined user profiles or user-specified profiles are used for individualizing or adapting content, the profile currently used should be made evident.

The 3 CвЂ™s (Core-Configuration-Customization) forms the guiding principle for the architecture. The functional architecture of the CCTNS solution is given in the figure below. The functional architecture is composed of 4 major components based on SOA principles. Each of the components contains multiple services as defined by Service Definition. The core services, support layer and security and access control components can be deployed as standard components with necessary configuration changes.

The key guiding principle behind the functional design of CCTNS V1.0 is to focus on the critical functionality that provides value to the police personnel at the cutting edge which in turn can improve the outcomes in the areas of вЂњInvestigation of CrimeвЂќ and вЂњDetection of CriminalsвЂќ.     </text_body> </p>  <p id=\"2\">     <title>     FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW     </title>     <text_body>         CCTNS V1.0 functionality is designed to focus on delivering value to IOs, records room staff and citizens within the broad crime investigation area. Based on the guiding principles stated above, nine different function blocks have been identified and the detailed functionality of each block was determined.     </text_body>  </p>  <p id=\"3\">     <title>     DESCRIPTION OF THE MODULES AND FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS     </title>     <text_body>        The functionality of the CCTNS application is focused on providing value to the police personnel, especially the officers operating at the cutting edge and easing the day to day operations of the police function.     </text_body>     <p id=\"\">         <title>         Registration         </title>         <text_body>         Citizens can register their complaints with police and then based on the evidence, facts and following investigation, police shall take the complaint forward. The Registration module acts as an interface between the police and citizens and it eases the approach, interaction and information exchange between police and complainants.         </text_body>     </p>     <p id=\"\">     <title>         Investigation         </title>         <text_body>                 After a complaint is initiated, police initiates the investigation process. The Investigation module of the CCTNS facilitates the investigation process and introduces operational efficiencies by automating most of the tasks that take place after initial entries are made during Registration.         </text_body>     </p>     <p id=\"\">         <title>         Prosecution         </title>         <text_body>         Interfacing with the courts during the prosecution of cases is an integral part of the responsibilities of police personnel. A designated constable from each police station constantly interfaces with the courts. The Prosecution module of the CCTNS aids this interfacing by providing a platform to record entries of the court interactions.                </text_body>     </p>       <p id=\"\">         <title>         Search         </title>         <text_body>         The Search module of the CCTNS gives police personnel the ability to execute a basic or advanced search on cases. Using the search functionality, police personnel can search for a particular person, type of crime, modus operandi, property etc. It also gives the user the ability to customize the results view by criminal/accused or by cases. It makes reporting easy for police by enabling them to execute different types of queries such as monthly reporting, RTI related etc.                 </text_body>     </p>              <p id=\"\">         <title>         Citizen Interface         </title>         <text_body>         The Citizen Interface module of the CCTNS acts as a conduit for the information exchange between citizens and police units/personnel. Citizens can use it as a tool to get information or acknowledgements from police. The police in turn can use it to respond to citizens with very little turnaround time. It improves overall productivity by helping citizens and police to cut short the drudgery of large amounts of paperwork.                 </text_body>     </p>              <p id=\"\">         <title>         Navigation         </title>         <text_body>         The Navigation module of the CCTNS provides role based landing pages which help in navigating through the CCTNS application. It shows information such as cases assigned, alerts, pending tasks etc hence helping police personnel to plan better and execute with greater efficiency.                 </text_body>     </p>              <p id=\"\">         <title>         Application Configuration         </title>         <text_body>         The Configuration module of the CCTNS helps keep the application configured according to the statesвЂ™ requirements in addition to keeping data elements/rules up to date. With a proper configuration, information such as act and sections, state specific data, castes, tribes, property information etc. can be created updated and deleted.

Overall layout schemes apply to all pages and are preferable when all pages have a similar structure. Frequently, however, different pages have different purposes and types of content. In such cases, pages can usually be grouped in different categories, using one layout scheme for each category consistently.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"36\">            <text_body>            Placing title information consistently: Page titles should be placed in a consistent location on the different pages.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"37\">            <text_body>            Observing principles of human perception When designing application pages, the general principles of human perception should be taken into account. The International Standards mentioned below shall be consulted for guidance. Practical guidelines for presenting information to the user are to be found in ISO 9241-12. Guidance on selecting and using different forms of interaction techniques is to be found in ISO 9241-14 to ISO 9241-17. ISO 9241-14 gives guidance about menus, ISO 9241-15 about command dialogues, ISO 9241-16 about direct manipulation and ISO 9241-17 about forms. In addition, when designing multimedia information presentations, the design principles and recommendations described in ISO 14915-1 to ISO 14915-3 should be taken into account. Appropriate content presentation also plays a key role in accessibility.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"38\">            <text_body>            Linking back to the home page or landmark pages: Each page should contain a link leading to the home page of the application or to a landmark page that is easy to recognize for the user.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"39\">            <text_body>            Providing a site map: A separate navigation overview such as a site map should be provided for application showing the structure of the site in an overview form.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"40\">            <text_body>            Consistency between navigation components and content: If navigation components (or overviews) are shown in conjunction with associated content, consistency between the navigation component and the content shown should be maintained by indicating in the navigation component (e.g. highlighting) the topic currently visible in the content area.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"41\">            <text_body>            Placing navigation components consistently: Navigation components should be placed consistently on the pages or in the framesets in the pages of the application.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"42\">            <text_body>            Individualization and user adaptation : Adapting the content and the navigation of a user interface to individual users or user groups can be a useful mechanism for providing information that is of interest to the users and for making access to relevant information more efficient. User adaptation can also be important for making the user interface more accessible. Different approaches can be used for achieving these goals, like providing users with means for customizing the user interface to their personal needs i.e. individualization designing content and navigation differently for varying user groups or roles i.e. such as employees of different levels, citizens etc, monitoring the userвЂ™s behaviour and adapting to the userвЂ™s goals that are inferred from the behaviour observed, recommending information that is potentially more relevant or interesting to the specific user, based on the behaviour of all users or a user group.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"43\">            <text_body>            Taking account of the usersвЂ™ tasks and information needs: When providing different access paths or navigation structures for different user groups, the tasks and information needs of these user groups should be taken into consideration.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"44\">            <text_body>            Making individualization and adaptation evident: It should be made evident to the user when individualization and/or adaptation are used.            </text_body>        </req>        <req id=\"45\">            <text_body>            Making user profiles evident: If predefined user profiles or user-specified profiles are used for individualizing or adapting content, the profile currently used should be made evident.

The 3 CвЂ™s (Core-Configuration-Customization) forms the guiding principle for the architecture. The functional architecture of the CCTNS solution is given in the figure below. The functional architecture is composed of 4 major components based on SOA principles. Each of the components contains multiple services as defined by Service Definition. The core services, support layer and security and access control components can be deployed as standard components with necessary configuration changes. The customization layer can override and add to the core services based on the specific state requirements and can be plugged with the core services.         The deployment of the application will be at state level and will be configured and customized as per the state specific extensions.
